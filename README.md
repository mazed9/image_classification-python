**Car Presence Classification using SVM**

This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) in Python with Scikit-learn to classify images as "empty" or "not_empty" based on the presence of cars. The SVM algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, and the model predicts car presence by analyzing features extracted from the images. The repository includes the Python code, and the dataset.
